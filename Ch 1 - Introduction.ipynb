    "If your exposure to the linear algebra was anything like my first course, you probably don't think back on the experience longingly, wishing you could relive those days. My professor literally opened the class by saying he didn't understand why linear algebra was interesting or useful. It was a pretty painful semester, full of abstract concepts like vector subspaces, and I just couldn't connect with the material. It wasn't until the end of my graduate school career when I took a class that beat me over the head with examples of how powerful and magical this subject can be. I want to share that experience with more people.\n",

    "Associating linear algebra with a kind of fascination or awe is especially helpful, because things like matrices and vectors have a way of showing up in just about every quantitative situation. In my world of signal processing and statistics, it's virtually impossible to get through a research paper without being comfortable manipulating vectors and matrices. \n",

    "Another reason why linear algebra applies to so many situations is that many problems which are *technically* nonlinear can be approximated as linear with a negligible amount of error. A common way this comes up (and a favorite approach of physicists everywhere) is by invoking a \"Taylor series approximation\". Imagine you are standing at a point $a$ on a number line, and you know the value of some function $f$ at your current location. If you were to move from $a$ to a new point $x$, the change you would see in the value of the function is a weighted sum of different derivatives of $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = f(a)+\\frac {f'(a)}{1!} (x-a)+ \\frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2+\\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+ \\cdots$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The weighting (read: \"practical importance\") of the terms depends on how far you have moved. For any function, in any practical situation, there will be some point close to $a$ where the error from throwing away all the terms which are nonlinear in $x$ is irrelevant to what you are trying to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, for $x$ \"very\" close to $a$:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$f(x) \\sim f(a)+\\frac {f'(a)}{1!} (x-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be helpful to see this visually. The figure below shows Taylor approximations to $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ for $a=0$. The order of the approximations are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. Notice how in the range (-1, 1), a straight line looks reasonably equivalent to $\\sin(x)$! Whether or not it is \"reasonable\" depends on your application.\n",
