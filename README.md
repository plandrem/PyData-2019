# A Crash Course in Applied Linear Algebra

These notebooks were written as companions to my talk at the PyData 2019 conference in NYC. They contain examples of topics from basic linear algebra courses like rank and eigenvectors, as well as some more advanced topics that are less familiar like the singular value decomposition. As much as possible, I've tried to include geometric 2D or 3D visualizations and coded python examples for all of the topics to make them more accessible.

These notebooks are *faaaaaaaar* from comprehensive. I've skipped a lot of formal math in favor of brevity and readability. The goal is to pique your interest so that you can go on and indulge in a more rigorous course. I highly recommend the materials from Stanford's ["Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems"](http://ee263.stanford.edu/
) course, which is the material that first excited me about the subject.
